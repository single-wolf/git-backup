# git-backup


## Overview

**git-backup.sh** is a shell script for `automatic and incremental backup` of git repositories. Using this script, developers donâ€™t need to worry about losing code due to incorrect merge branches and other computer emergencies. 

Most importantly, you can easily backup your git repositories periodically in background without modifying the content of the current working tree and index. In Additon, you can code, checkout or merge on the repository at will without worrying about conflicts between different backup, the backup script can track branches, and there will no conflicts between different branches and different developers with a configurable pushing remote.

Merge requests are welcome :)

**Features**:

1. Incrementally back up code to backup branch without modify current working tree and index
2. Execute once or periodically execute the back up by setting a cron
3. Support push backup branch to remote repositories and track the remote one
4. Support directory mode so that can back up all repositories under the given directory

**Wish List**:

- Support backup branch management, such as prune history backup periodically
- Support setting cron on Windows
- ...


## What It Does

- backup branch name `BACKUP${CURRENT_BRANCH}-${USR_NAME}` so that the backup will not conflict between developers
- detect the local and remote backup branch, compare the current working tree and index with latest backup if it exists
- skip the backup if current status is up-to-date or current working tree was already backup
- Add all file to backup branch and commit, push to remote if the option `-p` is given
- checkout current branch and recovery current working tree and index

## Usage

#### Synopsis

``` bash
git-backup.sh [-h] [-d] [repo-dir] [-c] [cron expression] [-p] [-n] [-r] [-l]
```

#### Description :

- [repo-dir]        the directory of git repository specified by `-d`, default is .
- [cron expression] cron expression of back up the git repo periodically,  specified by `-c`

#### Options :

- [-h] --help , print usage info and exit
- [-d] --dir [repo-dir] , specify the git repository
- [-p] --push , push the backup to remote, optional
- [-l] --log  , specify the periodical backup log file, default is ~/.gitbackup.log
- [-r] --recur, dir recurtive mode, backup all subdir at [repo-dir]
- [-n] --now  , do back up once right now
- [-c] --cron [cron expression], do back up periodically
- [-c/-n] must given at least one of two option

#### Examples :

1. Backup current git repository regularly and push remote
	- ./git-backup.sh -p -c '0 12 * * *'
2. Backup specified git repository once locally
	- ./git-backup.sh -n -d /User/xx/git-repo
3. Backup all subdirectory under /User/xx once and push remote
	- ./git-backup.sh -n -r -p -d /User/xx/

## FAQ

#### 1. Failed to push to remote during periodical execution, Permission denied (publickey)

Please make sure you have the correct access rights to the repository. If the script works well on command line, then you should check whether the ssh key is passwordless.
